&lt;p&gt;On November 29th, 2016, the Ember security team was notified that version &lt;code&gt;2.11.0-beta.1&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;code&gt;ember-source&lt;/code&gt; npm package inadvertently included a file...&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;title: [2016-11-29] Security Incident: AWS S3 Access Key Exposure
author: Tom Dale&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_tags-security'&gt;tags: Security&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 29th, 2016, the Ember security team was notified that version &lt;code&gt;2.11.0-beta.1&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;code&gt;ember-source&lt;/code&gt; npm package inadvertently included a file that contained an AWS access key. This access key had permissions for full read/write access to the Ember S3 buckets.
These buckets are used to distribute pre-built versions of Ember.js and related libraries and host other static content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ember.js via &lt;code&gt;builds.emberjs.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ember Data via &lt;code&gt;builds.emberjs.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backburner.js via &lt;code&gt;builds.emberjs.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handlebars.js via &lt;code&gt;builds.handlebarsjs.com.s3.amazonaws.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RSVP.js via &lt;code&gt;rsvpjs-builds.s3.amazonaws.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Router.js via &lt;code&gt;routerjs.builds.emberjs.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ember guides and API documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the vast majority of Ember users retrieve new releases from Bower or npm, the builds on S3 are frequently used with online tools like JSBin and Ember Twiddle or anywhere it is more convenient to add a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After performing a full audit, we concluded that the key was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; accessed during the timeframe of the incident, and there was no evidence of unauthorized activities. Therefore, &lt;strong&gt;no action is required on your part&lt;/strong&gt;. This notice is advisory and contains an incident description as well as our mitigation plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_incident-report'&gt;Incident Report&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 4:13pm PST on November 29th, version &lt;code&gt;2.11.0-beta.1&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;ember-source&lt;/code&gt; was published from the computer of a member of the Ember release team and inadvertently included the AWS access key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 9:25pm, a member of the Ember security team was privately notified of the key exposure. We immediately acknowledged the notification and began investigating the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 9:33pm, we confirmed the key exposure by installing the package from npm and examining its contents. We verified that there were no other Ember-related secrets included in the package other than the AWS access key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 10:26pm, we revoked access to the exposed access key. There was a delay between the incident verification and the key revocation because the individuals with administrator access to AWS were not at a computer when the report was received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the access key was revoked, we began to assess if the compromised key had been used by an unauthorized user. Concurrently, we began auditing when the access key was introduced to the &lt;code&gt;ember-source&lt;/code&gt; package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IAM Access Advisor in AWS indicated that the exposed access key only had permission to access S3 buckets, and that it had not been used in the past 376 days. We also verified that no previous releases contained the access key. This access key had not been used in over a year because we began publishing to S3 from our Continuous Integration server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because AWS indicates that the access key has not recently been used, and because it only had access to S3, we concluded that an unauthorized user had not been able to use the key before access was revoked. There was no indication that any files in our S3 buckets had been tampered with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this time, we decided against requesting that the affected package be yanked from npm. We know that yanked packages can cause sudden build failures and believed that any security risk had been mitigated by revoking the compromised access key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also audited the S3 access logs, which had been previously enabled. These logs did not indicate any unauthorized access. However, the logs themselves were stored in an S3 bucket that the compromised key had access to, so we did not consider them to be as reliable as the key&amp;#39;s last accessed date, which an unauthorized user would be unable to alter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_mitigations'&gt;Mitigations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have implemented or are planning to implement several mitigations to prevent exposures of this kind in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have begun removing permissions to access S3 from all IAM accounts associated with individual team members.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We no longer grant access to all S3 buckets to any one account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are migrating to a CI-deployed system so we will no longer need publish to npm or Bower from an individual&amp;#39;s computer. We will have our Continuous Integration system (and only our CI system) publish new releases, as we do with the builds that are uploaded to S3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will modify the S3 permissions to be &amp;quot;append only,&amp;quot; so our CI system can only upload new objects to S3, not delete or modify existing objects. This would prevent tampering with older releases and limit the extent of an attack if the keys are exposed in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are examining options for increasing the logging and auditability of our AWS infrastructure, such as enabling CloudTrail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_conclusion'&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We take the security of Ember and the applications you build with it very seriously. I sincerely apologize that we let this happen. We will work to improve our release process to prevent similar security lapses from happening in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are deeply appreciative that this mistake was responsibly disclosed so that we were able to revoke the access key before a malicious attacker took advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to extend a personal note of thanks to Marcelo Mira (@marcemira), who noticed the exposure and promptly reported the issue privately. This quick action prevented a bad situation from becoming much worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d also like to thank Godfrey Chan, who displayed exemplary professionalism, composure and diligence in quickly responding to the report late at night. He is a true asset to the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you discover a security-related issue in Ember, we ask that you follow our &lt;a href="/security/"&gt;disclosure policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_additional-reading'&gt;Additional Reading&lt;/h4&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, the Ember project is releasing Ember.js, Ember Data and Ember CLI
version 2.10.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also kicks off the 2.11 beta cycle for all sub-projects. We encourage our
community (especially addon authors) to help test these beta builds and report
any bugs before they are published as a final release in six weeks&amp;#39; time. The
&lt;a href="https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-try"&gt;ember-try&lt;/a&gt; addon is a great way to
continuously test your projects against the latest Ember releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with this release, we will be publishing a single, unified release
blog post summarizing all the changes for all three sub-projects in one place.
You can read more about our general release process here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/builds/"&gt;Release Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/blog/2013/09/06/new-ember-release-process.html"&gt;The Ember Release Cycle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/blog/2015/06/16/ember-project-at-2-0.html"&gt;The Ember Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/blog/2016/02/25/announcing-embers-first-lts.html"&gt;Ember LTS Releases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_ember-js'&gt;Ember.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ember.js is the core framework for building ambitious web applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_changes-in-ember-js-2-10'&gt;Changes in Ember.js 2.10&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ember.js 2.10 is the first release to include &lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/blog/2016/07/29/announcing-the-glimmer-2-alpha.html"&gt;Glimmer 2&lt;/a&gt;,
a ground-up rewrite of Ember&amp;#39;s rendering engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all the changes that took place under-the-hood, we are committed to
making this a &lt;strong&gt;drop-in, completely backwards compatible upgrade for virtually
all Ember.js users&lt;/strong&gt;. Over the past few months, we have been &lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/blog/2016/10/17/ember-2-9-released.html#toc_ember-js-2-10-beta"&gt;hard at work&lt;/a&gt;
to make this a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone in the community who took the time to test their apps and
addons against the Glimmer 2 alpha and beta builds, this has been one of the
most rigorously tested releases in the history of the Ember project. We are
quite confident that upgrade will go smoothly for most apps. However, if you
encounter any issues, please do report them to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/"&gt;issue tracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this release is focused on compatibility and does not expose any new
capabilities, the new rendering engine has unlocked a lot of &lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/blog/2016/07/29/announcing-the-glimmer-2-alpha.html#toc_a-whole-lot-more-to-come"&gt;new frontiers&lt;/a&gt;
for us, creating a much better foundation for adding new features as well as
room for future performance impovements. With the initial integration now out
of the way, we are quite excited to return our efforts to those areas in
upcoming releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_other-notable-changes'&gt;Other notable changes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Glimmer 2 integration, a few other notable changes are also
included in this release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;a href="https://github.com/trentmwillis"&gt;Trent Willis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/nathanhammond"&gt;Nathan Hammond&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="https://github.com/alexspeller"&gt;Alex Speller&lt;/a&gt; have contributed a series of
patches to address some long-standing issues and edge cases in the routing
layer, particularly in the area of query params.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/rwjblue"&gt;Robert Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, we now use
&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap"&gt;WeakMap&lt;/a&gt;
to &lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/13783"&gt;store object metadata&lt;/a&gt; on
browsers that supports them. A pleasant side-effect of this internal change is
that Ember no longer adds an &lt;code&gt;__ember_meta__&lt;/code&gt; property to every object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it has come to our attention that it is quite common for developers to
accidentally mutate the arguments passed into a helper. This is problematic as
these objects are often shared or reused, causing subtle issues that are very
difficult to debug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help track down these kind of issues, these objects are now &lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/14244"&gt;frozen&lt;/a&gt;
in the debug build before they are passed into helpers. As a result, you will
get an error if you attempt to modify these objects directly. It is recommended
that you clone these objects (e.g. using &lt;code&gt;Object.assign&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Array#slice&lt;/code&gt;)
before making any modifications to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(It has been brought to our attention that the last change might have an
&lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/14649"&gt;unintended consequence&lt;/a&gt;.
A fix is being worked on by &lt;a href="https://github.com/mixonic"&gt;Matthew Beale&lt;/a&gt;. Please
refer to the linked issue for a detailed description and suggested workaround.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more details on the changes in Ember.js 2.10, please review the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/releases/tag/v2.10.0"&gt;Ember.js 2.10.0 release page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_upcoming-changes-in-ember-js-2-11'&gt;Upcoming changes in Ember.js 2.11&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, no new features are planned for 2.11. However, there are a few
notable changes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to the change to helper arguments, concatenated properties (such as
&lt;code&gt;classNames&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;classNameBindings&lt;/code&gt;) are now &lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/14389"&gt;frozen&lt;/a&gt;
in debug builds to help track down unintended mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legacy &lt;code&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; helper (i.e. &lt;code&gt;{{render &amp;#39;foo&amp;#39;}}&lt;/code&gt;) has been &lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/14441"&gt;deprecated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The private &lt;code&gt;Component#renderToElement&lt;/code&gt; API has also been &lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/14482"&gt;deprecated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more details on the upcoming changes in Ember.js 2.11, please review the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/releases/tag/v2.11.0-beta.1"&gt;Ember.js 2.11.0-beta.1 release page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_ember-data'&gt;Ember Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ember Data is the offical data persistence library for Ember.js applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_changes-in-ember-data-2-10'&gt;Changes in Ember Data 2.10&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ember Data 2.10 represents the work of more than 10 direct contributors with
over 20 commits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been no user facing changes in Ember Data 2.10. Under the
hood, &lt;a href="https://github.com/runspired"&gt;Chris Thoburn&lt;/a&gt; has instrumented
Ember Data with internal tools making it easier to track the
performance of Ember Data. This instrumentation is stripped from
production builds and should have no impact on existing
applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris also
&lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/data/pull/4578"&gt;improved the messaging&lt;/a&gt;
around assertions and warnings when an adapter responds with no &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;
for a record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more details on the changes in Ember Data 2.10, please review the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/data/releases/tag/v2.10.0"&gt;Ember Data 2.10.0 release page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_upcoming-changes-in-ember-data-2-11'&gt;Upcoming changes in Ember Data 2.11&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ember Data 2.11 is already shaping up to be a big release with many
performance and documentation improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_hasmany-computed-property-keys'&gt;HasMany Computed Property Keys&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the performance improvements included in Ember Data
2.11 fixes an issue where changes to the records of a
&lt;code&gt;DS.hasMany()&lt;/code&gt; caused unnecessary work. As a result,
Ember Data would over-eagerly invalidate computed
properties that depended on these &lt;code&gt;hasMany&lt;/code&gt; relationships. Due to the
nature of the fix application code depending on a relationship array
without watching the contents of that array may need to be updated. For
example you may need to update computed property keys that depended on
&lt;code&gt;record.someHasManyRelationshipName&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;record.someHasManyRelationshipName.[]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_deprecations-in-ember-data-2-11'&gt;Deprecations in Ember Data 2.11&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ember Data now issues deprecation warnings for
&lt;code&gt;store#serialize()&lt;/code&gt;. Instead, it is recommended that you use
&lt;code&gt;record.serialize()&lt;/code&gt; in place of
&lt;code&gt;store.serialize(record)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;store#lookupAdapter()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;store#lookupSerializer()&lt;/code&gt; have also been
deprecated starting in Ember 2.11. These methods were never publicly
documented. In their place we recommend you use &lt;code&gt;store#adapterFor()&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code&gt;store#serializerFor()&lt;/code&gt; respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;store#recordIsLoaded()&lt;/code&gt; is deprecated in favor of
&lt;code&gt;store#hasRecordForId()&lt;/code&gt;, as the logic in these two methods has been
identical since
&lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/data/pull/2875"&gt;March 2015&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the deprecated methods mentioned above will be supported until
Ember Data 3.0. Until then they will log a deprecation warning to
encourage use of the recommended replacement APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_move-code-ds-improved-ajax-code-out-of-code-beta-code-channel'&gt;Move &lt;code&gt;ds-improved-ajax&lt;/code&gt; out of &lt;code&gt;beta&lt;/code&gt; channel&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;ds-improved-ajax&lt;/code&gt; implemented in
&lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/data/pull/3099"&gt;PR #3099&lt;/a&gt; aims to provide
public hooks on the &lt;code&gt;rest&lt;/code&gt; adapter for customizing requests. For example
to specify the HTTP method or
provide custom HTTP headers per request. This feature has been available
in beta builds since the 2.8 beta cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this feature slipped into the code base without going
though a proper RFC process. Despite being enabled in the beta channel
for a while now, we decided that it should be disabled again in favour
of a feature which has gone though the RFC process and benefited from
valuable community feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are aware that it is quite rare for a feature to be backed out from
the beta channel but we consider the ability to do so a strength of
our release process. We would like to thank everyone who took the time
to test their applications against the beta channel and we would
highly appreciate your feedback on the proposed replacement to this
functionality in
&lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/171"&gt;RFC #171&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more details on the upcoming changes in Ember Data 2.11, please review the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/data/releases/tag/v2.11.0-beta.1"&gt;Ember Data 2.11.0-beta.1 release page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_ember-cli'&gt;Ember CLI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ember CLI is the command line interface for managing and packaging Ember.js
applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_upgrading-ember-cli'&gt;Upgrading Ember CLI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may upgrade Ember CLI separately from Ember.js and Ember Data! To upgrade
your projects using &lt;code&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt; run &lt;code&gt;yarn upgrade ember-cli&lt;/code&gt;. To upgrade your
projects using &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; run &lt;code&gt;npm install --save-dev ember-cli&lt;/code&gt;. After running the
upgrade command run &lt;code&gt;ember init&lt;/code&gt; inside of the project directory to apply the
blueprint changes. You can view those changes for &lt;a href="https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-new-output/compare/v2.9.1...v2.10.0"&gt;applications here&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-addon-output/compare/v2.9.1...v2.10.0"&gt;addons here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_changes-in-ember-cli-2-10'&gt;Changes in Ember CLI 2.10&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ember CLI 2.10 no longer supports Node.js 0.10 per the
&lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/blog/2016/09/07/ember-node-lts-support.html"&gt;Ember Node.js LTS Support policy&lt;/a&gt;.
Further, it is the last release which will officially support Node.js 0.12
which will be &lt;a href="https://github.com/nodejs/LTS#lts-schedule"&gt;removed from support at the end of this year&lt;/a&gt;.
Please make sure you begin your migration to a newer version of Node.js as soon
as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_sorting-of-code-package-json-code'&gt;Sorting of &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to guarantee consistency with &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; and other tools Ember CLI now
&lt;a href="https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/6272"&gt;sorts &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; in accordance with the upstream patterns&lt;/a&gt;.
This may result in changes in execution order of the addons in your application
which should be non-breaking. If you experience issues you will
&lt;a href="https://ember-cli.com/extending/#configuring-your-ember-addon-properties"&gt;need to specify &lt;code&gt;before&lt;/code&gt; and/or &lt;code&gt;after&lt;/code&gt; in your addon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_concatenation'&gt;Concatenation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concatenation of assets has been implicit based upon file-system ordering. An
update to &lt;code&gt;broccoli-concat&lt;/code&gt; which changed the walk order of the file system to
guarantee consistency and stable concatenation broke the implicit reliance we
had on that ordering. To ensure that we remain backwards compatible
&lt;a href="https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/6081"&gt;we have changed our invocation pattern to reproduce the intended behavior&lt;/a&gt;.
Child modules without specific ordering will now be sorted lexicographically
inside of your assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also moved to a &lt;a href="https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/issues/6300"&gt;system-independent line separator&lt;/a&gt;
to guarantee that builds are reproducible across different operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_code-npm-code-upgrade'&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; Upgrade&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/dfreeman"&gt;Dan Freeman&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href="https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/6306"&gt;updated our bundled &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; dependency&lt;/a&gt;
to &lt;code&gt;npm@3&lt;/code&gt;. This will change the resulting &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; folder layout inside
of your application when you run &lt;code&gt;ember install&lt;/code&gt;. This will likely only cause
problems if you tried to guess at the path to a module based upon install
behavior. If you need to identify the path to a module inside of the &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt;
JavaScript world be sure you&amp;#39;re using &lt;code&gt;require.resolve(&amp;#39;module-name&amp;#39;);&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_testing-addons'&gt;Testing Addons&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ember CLI 2.10 removes Ember.js 1.13 from the default testing matrix in the
addon blueprint. Given that we now have two LTS releases in the Ember.js 2.x
series, we no longer feel that supporting Ember.js 1.13 is a reasonable
default for newly-created addons. You may continue to support Ember.js 1.13 in
your addons (and in most cases it&amp;#39;s simple to do) by adding it back into the
testing matrix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more details on the changes in Ember CLI 2.10 and detailed upgrade
instructions, please review the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/releases/tag/v2.10.0"&gt;Ember CLI 2.10.0 release page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_upcoming-changes-in-ember-cli-2-11'&gt;Upcoming changes in Ember CLI 2.11&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our continous incremental progress toward making &lt;code&gt;bower&lt;/code&gt; optional inside of
Ember CLI we have moved to include Ember.js itself via
&lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ember-source"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ember-source&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;–provided via &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt;.
In 2.11 we will no longer have any packages provided by &lt;code&gt;bower&lt;/code&gt; in a brand
new Ember.js application!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ember CLI 2.11 will not officially support Node.js 0.12 per the
&lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/blog/2016/09/07/ember-node-lts-support.html"&gt;Ember Node.js LTS Support policy&lt;/a&gt;.
Please make sure you begin your migration to a newer version of Node.js as soon
as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a litany of other smaller improvements in this release:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We bundle a new and improved version of &lt;code&gt;ember-welcome-page&lt;/code&gt;, the learning
team&amp;#39;s addon for providing a quick start introduction for users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;a href="https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/6436"&gt;watch the &lt;code&gt;vendor&lt;/code&gt; folder by default&lt;/a&gt;,
making rebuilds work for changes in that directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stefan Penner made it so we do a better job at &lt;a href="https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/6423"&gt;cleanup upon exit of Ember CLI&lt;/a&gt;
preventing pollution of the &lt;code&gt;tmp&lt;/code&gt; folder inside of your applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robert Jackson dramatically &lt;a href="https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/6453"&gt;reduced the number of merge steps&lt;/a&gt; inside of the build,
speeding up the build process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more details on the changes in Ember CLI 2.11.0-beta.1 and detailed upgrade
instructions, please review the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/releases/tag/v2.11.0-beta.1"&gt;Ember CLI 2.11.0-beta.1 release page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_thank-you'&gt;Thank You!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a community-driven open-source project with an ambitious scope, each of
these releases serve as a reminder that the Ember project would not have been
possible without your continued support. We are extremely grateful to our
contributors for their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, we are releasing Ember 2.8-LTS (a long-term support release), Ember 2.9.0 and Ember 2.10 beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="anchorable-toc" id="toc_ember-js-2-8-lts"&gt;Ember.js 2.8-LTS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ember 2.8-LTS is our second long-term support release. You can install it by running &lt;code&gt;bower install --save ember#lts-2-8&lt;/code&gt; in your projects...&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, we are releasing Ember 2.8-LTS (a long-term support release), Ember 2.9.0 and Ember 2.10 beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_ember-js-2-8-lts'&gt;Ember.js 2.8-LTS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ember 2.8-LTS is our second long-term support release. You can install it by running &lt;code&gt;bower install --save ember#lts-2-8&lt;/code&gt; in your projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LTS channel is designed for Ember users who would like to upgrade less frequently, while still getting support from the project and the wider ecosystem. At the same time, it allows addon authors to know which versions of Ember to focus their effort on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Per our &lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/blog/2016/02/25/announcing-embers-first-lts.html"&gt;usual policy&lt;/a&gt;, Ember 2.8-LTS is released six weeks after the &lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/blog/2016/09/08/ember-2-8-and-2-9-beta-released.html#toc_ember-js-2-8"&gt;2.8.0 stable release&lt;/a&gt;. This allows ample time to fix any reported regressions and ensures a rock solid LTS release. It will continue to receive critical bugfixes for six release cycles (roughly June 2017), and security patches for ten release cycles (roughly February 2018).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Ember 2.4-LTS will continue to receive critical bugfixes for another two release cycles (roughly January 2017), and security patches for six release cycles (roughly June 2017). Users of Ember 2.4-LTS should make use of this overlapping period to transition over to Ember 2.8-LTS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most notably, as we have mentioned in the &lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/blog/2016/04/11/ember-2-5-released.html#toc_notable-deprecations-in-ember-2-4-lts"&gt;Ember 2.4-LTS announcement&lt;/a&gt;, applications who are using the legacy views and controllers addons will need to migrate away from these addons before they can upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more details on the changes landing in Ember.js 2.8-LTS, please review the &lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/v2.8.2/CHANGELOG.md"&gt;Ember.js 2.8.2 CHANGELOG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_ember-js-2-9'&gt;Ember.js 2.9&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/blog/2016/09/08/ember-2-8-and-2-9-beta-released.html#toc_ember-js-2-9-beta"&gt;Ember 2.9 beta blog post&lt;/a&gt;, we announced our intention to include the new Glimmer 2 rendering engine in the 2.9 release. However, after careful consideration, we have decided to temporarily hold off on the integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This means that 2.9 will ship with the same rendering engine as 2.8 and does not include any new features, notable changes or deprecations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we moved ahead with Glimmer in the 2.9 beta channel in September, all of Ember&amp;#39;s tests were passing, we had no known blockers and it was already working fine for a number of apps we tested (including some core team member&amp;#39;s production apps). Due to the magnitude of the internal changes, we fully expected to find bugs not already covered by our initial testing, so we called for the community to beta test the release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got a lot of positive results during the beta period, and some of our community sites (such as &lt;a href="https://emberobserver.com/"&gt;Ember Observer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.emberaddons.com/"&gt;Ember Addons&lt;/a&gt;) have already migrated to using the beta in production. However, as more apps tested the beta, we began to see a few critical edge cases reported during the mid-to-late part of the beta cycle. We were able to fix a number of them, but at this point, there are still a &lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/milestone/29"&gt;handful of open issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we said in the &lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/blog/2016/09/08/ember-2-8-and-2-9-beta-released.html#toc_compatibility-first"&gt;Ember 2.9 beta announcement&lt;/a&gt;, the &amp;quot;primary goal of this release is maximal compatibility – &lt;strong&gt;we expect the final release to be a drop-in, completely backwards compatible upgrade for virtually all Ember users&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;. Therefore, we decided to err on the side of caution and take another six weeks to ensure the smoothest possible experience for our users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is quite rare for a feature to be backed out from the beta channel, we consider the ability to do so a strength of our &lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/blog/2013/09/06/new-ember-release-process.html#toc_the-beta-branch"&gt;release process&lt;/a&gt;, and we would like to thank everyone who took the time to test their application against the beta channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more details on the changes landing in Ember.js 2.9, please review the &lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/v2.9.0/CHANGELOG.md"&gt;Ember.js 2.9.0 CHANGELOG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_ember-js-2-10-beta'&gt;Ember.js 2.10 beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, we will continue the Glimmer 2 integration work in Ember 2.10 beta, with a focus on resolving the &lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/milestone/29"&gt;remaining compatibility issues&lt;/a&gt;. You can &lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/blog/2016/09/08/ember-2-8-and-2-9-beta-released.html#toc_ember-js-2-9-beta"&gt;read about the integration&lt;/a&gt; in the original announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;#39;t already, we highly encourage you to test your application against 2.10 beta as soon as possible and report any issues you encounter. Given that it already went through a complete beta cycle and we were quite close to releasing it, we expect this to go smoothly for most apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more details on changes landing in 2.10 beta, review the &lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/v2.10.0-beta.1/CHANGELOG.md"&gt;Ember.js 2.10.0-beta.1 CHANGELOG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, the Ember core team is happy to announce two new Ember.js releases –
Ember.js 2.8 and Ember.js 2.9 beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_ember-js-2-8'&gt;Ember.js 2.8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ember.js 2.8 is a minor release with only backwards compatible changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_lts-candidate'&gt;LTS Candidate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ember.js 2.8 release is considered a release candidate for the LTS
(long-term support) channel. As described in the &lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/blog/2016/02/25/announcing-embers-first-lts.html"&gt;original LTS announcement&lt;/a&gt;,
the 2.8 branch will be moved into the LTS channel six weeks after today&amp;#39;s
release. Although we don&amp;#39;t anticipate any issues, this process ensures the LTS
releases will be rock solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_engines'&gt;Engines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ember.js 2.8 introduced a new &lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/10"&gt;Engines&lt;/a&gt;
API, which allows multiple logical applications to be composed together into a
single application from the user&amp;#39;s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to use this feature in your apps is through the &lt;a href="http://github.com/dgeb/ember-engines"&gt;ember-engines addon&lt;/a&gt;.
To get started, check out the excellent &lt;a href="https://github.com/dgeb/ember-engines/blob/master/guides/01-introduction.md"&gt;guides&lt;/a&gt;
written by &lt;a href="https://github.com/trentmwillis"&gt;@trentmwillis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release introduced a set of low-level APIs for the core functionality
along with the usual semver guarantees. While the ember-engines addon itself
remains experimental, the introduction of these public APIs means that
&lt;strong&gt;ember-engines is now usable with Ember.js 2.8&lt;/strong&gt; without feature flags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work on engines has proceeded over the past year in both Ember core as well as
the addon. Ember&amp;#39;s architecture has been enhanced to provide the base classes
and hooks needed to support engines. The addon then makes use of these
interfaces to provide a smooth experience building and consuming engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until now, none of the engine-related classes and hooks in Ember have been
exposed publicly. However, starting with Ember.js 2.8, the following APIs are
now public:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ember.Engine&lt;/code&gt; class - The base class for &lt;code&gt;Ember.Application&lt;/code&gt;. Its only
public interface is related to initializers and instance initializers, which
is then inherited by applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ember.EngineInstance&lt;/code&gt; class - The base class for &lt;code&gt;Ember.ApplicationInstance&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{mount}}&lt;/code&gt; helper - Allows for the mounting of routeless engines in
templates. This helper currently only takes one argument, the name of the
engine, e.g. &lt;code&gt;{{mount &amp;quot;chat-engine&amp;quot;}}&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mount&lt;/code&gt; router DSL - Allows routable engines to be mounted at a location in
a route map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By making these APIs public, ember-engines and other addons will be able to
access them without a feature-flag. By accessing only public interfaces in
Ember, an addon won&amp;#39;t need to rely on private overrides and can provide as
stable an experience as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We predict that engines will grow in popularity once work on lazy loading is
complete. By delaying the loading of engines until they&amp;#39;re accessed, we can
decrease the initial payload size and startup time for applications. If you&amp;#39;re
interested in helping to implement or test lazy loading of engines, please
check out the thorough &lt;a href="https://github.com/dgeb/ember-engines/issues/154"&gt;attack plan&lt;/a&gt;
written up by &lt;a href="https://github.com/nathanhammond"&gt;@nathanhammond&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_other-notable-features'&gt;Other Notable Features&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_code-enumerable-includes-code-and-code-array-includes-code'&gt;&lt;code&gt;Enumerable#includes&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Array#includes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to remain in line with ES standards, the methods &lt;code&gt;Enumerable#contains&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code&gt;Array#contains&lt;/code&gt; have been deprecated in favor of the new methods &lt;code&gt;Enumerable#includes&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code&gt;Array#includes&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addon authors should use &lt;a href="https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-runtime-enumerable-includes-polyfill"&gt;ember-runtime-enumerable-includes-polyfill&lt;/a&gt;
to fix the deprecation in a backwards-compatible way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/alexspeller"&gt;@alexspeller&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0136-contains-to-includes.md"&gt;RFC&lt;/a&gt;
that proposed this change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks as well to &lt;a href="https://github.com/bmeurant"&gt;@bmeurant&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/13553"&gt;PR&lt;/a&gt;
that implemented the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_code-ember-string-ishtmlsafe-code'&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ember.String.isHTMLSafe&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new method &lt;code&gt;Ember.String.isHTMLSafe&lt;/code&gt; detects if a string was decorated
using &lt;code&gt;Ember.String.htmlSafe&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight javascript "&gt;&lt;div class="ribbon"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="scroller"&gt;&lt;table class="CodeRay"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class="line-numbers"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;1
2
3
4
5
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; plainString = &lt;span class="string"&gt;&lt;span class="delimiter"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="content"&gt;plain string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="delimiter"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
    safeString = Ember.String.htmlSafe(&lt;span class="string"&gt;&lt;span class="delimiter"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="content"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;someValue&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="delimiter"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;);

Ember.String.isHTMLSafe(plainString); &lt;span class="comment"&gt;// false&lt;/span&gt;
Ember.String.isHTMLSafe(safeString);  &lt;span class="comment"&gt;// true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/workmanw"&gt;@workmanw&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/139"&gt;RFC&lt;/a&gt;
that proposed this new API, as well as the &lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/13666"&gt;PR&lt;/a&gt;
that implemented it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a related note, please create safe strings with &lt;code&gt;Ember.String.htmlSafe&lt;/code&gt;
instead of the using the deprecated &lt;code&gt;Ember.Handlebars.SafeString&lt;/code&gt;. See the
&lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/deprecations/v2.x/#toc_use-ember-string-htmlsafe-over-ember-handlebars-safestring"&gt;deprecation guide&lt;/a&gt;
for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_code-ember-test-checkwaiters-code'&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ember.Test.checkWaiters&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new method &lt;code&gt;Ember.Test.checkWaiters&lt;/code&gt; provides a simple mechanism for test
tooling to determine whether all async test waiters have settled. This replaces
the intimate API &lt;code&gt;Ember.Test.waiters&lt;/code&gt;, which has been removed in Ember.js 2.8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/rwjblue"&gt;@rwjblue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/krisselden"&gt;@krisselden&lt;/a&gt;
for implementing this method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more details on the changes landing in Ember.js 2.8, review the &lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/v2.8.0/CHANGELOG.md"&gt;Ember.js 2.8.0 CHANGELOG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_ember-js-2-9-beta'&gt;Ember.js 2.9 beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ember.js 2.9 beta is also being released today. Per our usual &lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/builds/#/beta"&gt;release cadence&lt;/a&gt;,
it will be released to the stable channel in six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release will not introduce any new features or deprecations. Instead, this
release will be focused around integrating the Glimmer 2 rendering engine into
Ember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_glimmer-2'&gt;Glimmer 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this year&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OInJBwS8VDQ&amp;amp;list=PL4eq2DPpyBblc8aQAd516-jGMdAhEeUiW"&gt;EmberConf keynote&lt;/a&gt;,
Yehuda mentioned that we are working on a highly optimized rendering engine for
Ember called Glimmer 2. A few weeks ago, we announced the &lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/blog/2016/07/29/announcing-the-glimmer-2-alpha.html"&gt;Glimmer 2 alpha&lt;/a&gt;
to invite our community to help test the new engine. Today, we are very excited
to announce that the Glimmer 2 engine will be included in the 2.9 beta release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_compatibility-first'&gt;Compatibility First&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, the initial Glimmer 2 integration does not expose any new
user-facing features. The primary goal of this release is maximal compatibility
– &lt;strong&gt;we expect the final release to be a drop-in, completely backwards
compatible upgrade for virtually all Ember users&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the alpha testing period, the Ember core team and our community were
laser-focused and worked really hard to achieve this goal. Thanks to all the
alpha testers, addon authors and contributors who reported issues or chimed in
with patches, we are able to meet our compatibility target and feel confident
about including Glimmer 2 with the 2.9 release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, despite our &lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/13127"&gt;best efforts&lt;/a&gt;
and the extensive alpha testing, we still might have gotten a few details
wrong, hence the beta releases. We would really appreciate it if you could
start testing your applications and report any regressions, if you have not
already done so. You may refer to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/13949"&gt;master issue&lt;/a&gt;
for a list of known issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also worth noting that the 2.8-LTS release (when available) will be the
final &lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/blog/2016/02/25/announcing-embers-first-lts.html"&gt;LTS release&lt;/a&gt;
to include the current-generation rendering engine, which will be supported
with critical bugfixes until at least May 2017 and security patches until at
least October 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_new-template-serialization-format'&gt;New Template Serialization Format&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glimmer 2 adopted a new serialization format for the precompiled templates. The
new serialization format offers a few benefits – among them are reduced byte
size (hence download time) and parse time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take this simple template for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight handlebars "&gt;&lt;div class="ribbon"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="scroller"&gt;&lt;table class="CodeRay"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class="line-numbers"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Hello &lt;span class="inline"&gt;&lt;span class="inline-delimiter"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="attribute-name"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="inline-delimiter"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;! &lt;span class="inline"&gt;&lt;span class="inline-delimiter"&gt;{{#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="attribute-name"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attribute-name"&gt;isFriday&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="inline-delimiter"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Happy Friday!!!&lt;span class="inline"&gt;&lt;span class="inline-delimiter"&gt;{{/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="attribute-name"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="inline-delimiter"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ember.js 2.8, this template compiles into a JavaScript function with 2273
bytes, or 472 bytes minified and gzipped. At the time of writing, Ember.js 2.9
beta compiles the same template into a JSON string with 374 bytes, or 213 bytes
minified and gzipped. You can explore the difference in &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/chancancode/6ddef7c343873e5c9c5ea99106cdc238"&gt;this gist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few caveats with the previous paragraph. First of all, the details
of the templates serialization is a private API that is subject to change
anytime and should not be relied on. Second, the reduction varies between
templates, depending on various factors such as the number of blocks used in
the template. Third, minification and gzip are usually applied to the entire
application bundle and they work a bit differently in those environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, these numbers offer a good ballpark estimates on what you could
expect. From our experience, the reduction generally scales well and holds up
in real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the byte size savings, the JSON serialization format also reduces parse
time and allows us to defer the work till the template is actually used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an area that is still being actively worked on, and we expect the
serialization format to go through some more changes before the Ember.js 2.9
stable release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_performance'&gt;Performance&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the overarching goals of the Glimmer 2 project is to improve performance
in Ember. While compatibility is the immediate priority for this release,
performance remains an important secondary consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our conservative goal for this first release is to avoid introducing any
accidental performance regressions. Based on our testing, we have cleared that
goal with ample headroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the benefits of Glimmer 2 begin to trickle in, we have already seen
noticeable improvements to rendering performance (both initial render and
re-rendering). Among other things, the &lt;code&gt;{{link-to}}&lt;/code&gt; helper and &lt;code&gt;{{#each}}&lt;/code&gt;
loops with big lists appear to be significantly faster. Component instantiation
has also seen some modest improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we have also noticed a performance regression in the pre-render phase.
Specifically, we have seen a small increase in the &lt;code&gt;vendor.js&lt;/code&gt; byte size and an
increased delay before the application gets to render anything. This regression
eats into the rendering improvements. We are actively working on these issues
and we expect them to be addressed before the final release in Ember 2.9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the caveats, our data suggest the savings from template byte size and
improved rendering performance more than offset the current issues. Therefore,
we expect most applications to see an overall improvement in performance upon
upgrading to the beta release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that these observations are recorded from complex production
applications maintained by members of the core team (as opposed to isolated
synthetic benchmarks). Given the current state of affairs, we are hesitant to
circulate premature numbers that are specific to a handful of applications. We
plan to perform some thorough analysis as we get closer to the final release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we encourage you to test the beta release against your own
applications. If you notice that certain common patterns have become slower,
please report them as bugs. As always – when running performance benchmarks,
&lt;strong&gt;please make sure you are using the minified production build&lt;/strong&gt;
(&lt;code&gt;ember.min.js&lt;/code&gt;). The debug builds contain a lot of helpful development aids
that impact performance negatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_future-work'&gt;Future Work&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this release serves as an important milestone and proving ground for the
Glimmer 2 project, we are barely scratching the surface here. One of the
informal mandates of the Ember project is &amp;quot;we will keep on shipping&amp;quot;, and this
is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Glimmer 2 engine unlocks a whole new arena of performance optimizations.
Once the dust settles, we are committed to keep iterating on performance
improvements. Ultimately, our goal is to make the overhead of breaking up an
app into small, composable components negligible over time. We are optimistic
that there will still be ample headroom for further improvements in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides performance, Glimmer 2 has laid a solid foundation for us to build on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project originally started when Tom, Yehuda and I spiked on implementing
&amp;quot;angle bracket components&amp;quot; in the HTMLBars (&amp;quot;Glimmer 1&amp;quot;) engine over a year
ago. This exercise highlighted some fundamental misalignments between the
current rendering stack and the direction Ember is headed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While HTMLBars handled basic templating, it left the implementation of many of
Ember&amp;#39;s view layer features (notably components) up to Ember itself. Not only
did it make new features more difficult to implement, it made it hard to
implement them &lt;em&gt;efficiently&lt;/em&gt; out of the gate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ember has moved towards components and &amp;quot;data-down, actions-up&amp;quot;, we wanted to
do many optimizations that just weren&amp;#39;t a good fit for the HTMLBars
architecture. The lessons we learned from the spike ultimately leading us down
the journey that is now known as the Glimmer 2 architecture. The underlying
technologies are very interesting, but I will save those details for another
time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As an Ember user, you can expect the new engine to unlock some long-awaited
features&lt;/strong&gt;, such as FastBoot rehydration, incremental rendering and a refreshed
approach to components once the initial integration is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_thank-you'&gt;Thank You!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://github.com/tildeio/glimmer/compare/rip-htmlbars...master"&gt;forking HTMLBars&lt;/a&gt;,
the Glimmer repo has clocked over 850 commits, not to mention the &lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues?q=label:Glimmer2+is:closed"&gt;integration effort&lt;/a&gt;
that happened on the Ember side and also in the wider ecosystem. All of these
would not be possible without the help from our community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to every one who helped us get here – from the &lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/sponsors/"&gt;companies&lt;/a&gt;
who donated employees&amp;#39; time to the individual contributors who made personal
sacrifices to make this happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ember is committed to being a good steward of our collective codebases as part of the &lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/en/"&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/"&gt;ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;. In that spirit we will be following the &lt;a href="https://github.com/nodejs/LTS#lts-schedule"&gt;Node.js Long Term Support Schedule&lt;/a&gt; to provide clear guarantees of which versions of Node.js we support and how long we will support them. We will test against the same set of releases which the Node.js Long-term Support Working Group says they support: any &amp;quot;Current&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Active LTS&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Maintenance&amp;quot; releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_what-does-support-mean'&gt;What does support mean?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Ember projects can be expected to work in any of the supported Node.js versions and will support every documented feature. We will not maintain separate branches or classes of support for different Node.js support classifications. For example, Ember CLI can be expected to work just the same running on a &amp;quot;Maintenance&amp;quot; Node.js version as it does on a &amp;quot;Current&amp;quot; Node.js version. Not all of our projects presently align to this pattern but we will, over time, coalesce to this state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting this commitment does not come without cost and tough decisions. However, as maintainers of foundational libraries, we believe that it is in our best interest to validate the legitimacy of the Node.js LTS plans, help position Node.js as a reliable and dependable tool for all enterprises, and contribute toward improving the reputation of the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_how-we-drop-support'&gt;How We Drop Support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it easier for us to deliver on our support promise we have adopted a policy that the &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; of our &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branches will be compatible with all versions of Node.js currently receiving support. For any Ember project on the day we drop support for a Node.js version the following things will happen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will update the &lt;code&gt;engines&lt;/code&gt; key inside of &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; to specify the versions supported by the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will update the testing targets to remove the newly-unsupported Node.js version from the list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will begin accepting code without testing it against the newly-unsupported version of Node.js.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For projects with an unspecified release model we will release one last version of the project prior to those steps. The version number change will reflect &lt;a href="http://semver.org/"&gt;SemVer&lt;/a&gt; with respect to the APIs of the project and not take into consideration removal of Node.js version support. This means that the release may show up as a &amp;quot;patch&amp;quot; version release. For example, if we&amp;#39;re dropping support for Node.js 0.10 and have a project at version 1.3.3 we can drop Node.js 0.10 support when we release version 1.3.4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Ember CLI, which follows a six week release train model, we will continue to patch the currently released version and maintain compatibility. Those patches will not break compatibility with the Node.js versions that Ember CLI supported when it was released. The next six week release of Ember CLI will drop support for the newly-unsupported Node.js version. For example, if we release Ember CLI 2.8.0 on September 6, drop support for Node.js 0.10 on October 1, and discover a bug on October 5 necessitating a 2.8.1 patch release that release will support Node.js 0.10 even though we have officially dropped support. The first version which will not support Node.js 0.10 will be Ember CLI 2.9.0 scheduled to be released on October 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_node-js-0-10-node-js-0-12'&gt;Node.js 0.10 &amp;amp; Node.js 0.12&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next four months Node.js will remove the 0.10 and 0.12 versions from &amp;quot;Maintenance.&amp;quot; We in the Ember community will follow suit. This means that on October 1, 2016 we will drop support for Node.js 0.10 and on January 1, 2017 we will drop support for Node.js 0.12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these versions are very long in the tooth and have had a good run but we&amp;#39;re not sad to see them go. We&amp;#39;re looking forward to getting to use &lt;a href="http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/#node012"&gt;language features we&amp;#39;ve had for years in other environments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_recommended-version'&gt;Recommended Version&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recommend that you use the most-recent &amp;quot;Active LTS&amp;quot; version of Node.js. At present that is &lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/"&gt;Node.js v4.5.0&lt;/a&gt;. This is not to say that you may not use other versions, but by rule the current &amp;quot;Active LTS&amp;quot; will receive the most attention during our testing cycles and be most broadly used within the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_future-plans'&gt;Future Plans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recognize that we don&amp;#39;t have the privilege of unilaterally setting this as the default for the entire Node.js ecosystem. It is our hope that with leadership from our community we can encourage more of the Node.js ecosystem to commit to following the schedule laid out by the Node.js LTS Working Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t presently rely upon transpilation to support older versions of the Node.js runtime from a codebase using current JavaScript features. This may change in time but we don&amp;#39;t yet believe the story for tooling and debugging of transpiled JavaScript for Node.js has reached the inflection point where the benefits outweigh the costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, if we find ourselves maintaining our own forks or depending upon legacy versions of much of the JavaScript ecosystem, we reserve the option to change our approach in the future. As always we will be paying close attention to the community&amp;#39;s needs and will give at least a six month notice of any change to this stated support policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/ErisDS"&gt;Hannah Wolfe&lt;/a&gt; for helping direct us to this approach.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this year&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OInJBwS8VDQ&amp;amp;list=PL4eq2DPpyBblc8aQAd516-jGMdAhEeUiW"&gt;EmberConf keynote&lt;/a&gt;,  Yehuda mentioned that we are working on a highly optimized rendering engine for Ember called Glimmer 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On behalf of all the contributors who have lent a hand along the way, I am very excited to announce that we have just released Ember 2.9.0-alpha.1, the first official build with Glimmer 2 included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_a-key-milestone'&gt;🔑 A Key Milestone 🔑&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the alpha testing period, we will publish new alpha builds on a weekly cadence, following the &lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/builds/#/beta"&gt;beta releases schedule&lt;/a&gt;. The alpha releases will be cut from the master branch, but with all &lt;a href="https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.7.0/configuring-ember/feature-flags/"&gt;experimental features&lt;/a&gt; other than &lt;code&gt;ember-glimmer&lt;/code&gt; stripped from the builds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the alpha releases is to enable our community – especially the addon and tooling ecosystem – to start testing the new engine for compatibility and offer feedback. Needless to say, the alpha releases are not intended for production use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test your apps with the alpha builds, simply run &lt;code&gt;bower install --save ember#alpha&lt;/code&gt; and follow the prompt to persist the resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Ember&amp;#39;s perspective, integrating Glimmer 2 does not expose any new user-facing features. Even though it is a complete rewrite under the hood, &lt;strong&gt;we expect the final release to be a drop-in, completely backwards compatible upgrade&lt;/strong&gt; for virtually all Ember users. Notably, we will follow our usual &lt;a href="http://semver.org"&gt;SemVer&lt;/a&gt; guarantee and ensure all public APIs continue to function as advertised. At this point, we do not expect to introduce any new deprecations along with the initial release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, despite our &lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/13127"&gt;best efforts&lt;/a&gt;, we might not have gotten every detail right in our very first attempt, hence the alpha releases. We would really appreciate it if you could start testing your applications and report any regressions. You may refer to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/13949"&gt;master issue&lt;/a&gt; for a list of known issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that the version number (2.9.0-alpha.1) does not imply the new engine will be automatically included in the 2.9 final release. Just like any other changes, the Glimmer 2 integration is subject to the usual rigor and stability requirements of our &lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/blog/2013/09/06/new-ember-release-process.html"&gt;release process&lt;/a&gt;. The core team will make the final decision on when to promote the feature into beta and stable releases based on our learnings from the alpha period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on current information, the 2.8-LTS release (when available) will likely be the final &lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/blog/2016/02/25/announcing-embers-first-lts.html"&gt;LTS release&lt;/a&gt; to include the current-generation rendering engine, which will be supported with critical bugfixes until at least May 2017 and security patches until at least October 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_a-note-on-performance'&gt;🚀 A Note On Performance 🚀&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While one of the overarching goals of Glimmer 2 is to improve performance, the immediate priority in the alpha phase is maximal compatibility. We are barely scratching the surface with the possible optimizations unlocked by the new engine, and once the dust settles there will be ample headroom for further improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, you should start seeing some improvements in rendering performance with each alpha release, as well as reduced download/parsing time thanks to the new templates serialization format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also aware of a few minor bugs that cause performance problems in the first alpha release, which we plan to address quickly. However, it is also possible that we inadvertently regressed performance in certain scenarios. If you noticed certain common patterns have become slower, please report them as bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always – when running performance benchmarks, &lt;strong&gt;please make sure you are using the minified production build&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;code&gt;ember.min.js&lt;/code&gt;). The debug builds contain a lot of helpful development aids that are known to impact performance negatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_a-whole-lot-more-to-come'&gt;🎁 A Whole Lot More To Come 🎁&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides performance, Glimmer 2 has laid a solid foundation for us to build on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project originally started when Tom, Yehuda and I spiked on implementing &amp;quot;angle bracket components&amp;quot; in the HTMLBars (&amp;quot;Glimmer 1&amp;quot;) engine over a year ago. This exercise highlighted some fundamental misalignments between the current rendering stack and the direction Ember is headed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While HTMLBars handled basic templating, it left the implementation of many of Ember&amp;#39;s view layer features (notably components) up to Ember itself. Not only did it make new features more difficult to implement, it made it hard to implement them &lt;em&gt;efficiently&lt;/em&gt; out of the gate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ember has moved towards components and &amp;quot;data-down, actions-up&amp;quot;, we wanted to do many optimizations that just weren&amp;#39;t a good fit for the HTMLBars architecture. The lessons we learned from the spike ultimately leading us down the journey that is now known as the Glimmer 2 architecture. The underlying technologies are very interesting, but I will save those details for another time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As an Ember user, you can expect the new engine to unlock some long-awaited features&lt;/strong&gt;, such as FastBoot rehydration and a refreshed approach to components once the initial integration is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_a-big-thank-you'&gt;❤️ A Big Thank You ❤️&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://github.com/tildeio/glimmer/compare/rip-htmlbars...master"&gt;forking HTMLBars&lt;/a&gt;, the Glimmer repo has received over 700 commits, not to mention the &lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues?page=1&amp;amp;q=label%3AGlimmer2+is%3Aclosed"&gt;integration effort&lt;/a&gt; that happened on the Ember side, all of which would not be possible without the help from our community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to every one who helped us get here – from the &lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/sponsors/"&gt;companies&lt;/a&gt; who donated employees&amp;#39; time to the individual contributors who made personal sacrifices to make this happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of that out of the way – &lt;em&gt;happy alpha testing&lt;/em&gt;! 🍾🎊🎉&lt;/p&gt;
